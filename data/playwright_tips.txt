Playwright is a modern end-to-end testing framework that automates browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and WebKit.

Advantages:
- Supports multiple browsers and devices.
- Fast and reliable execution using headless mode.
- Built-in wait mechanism (auto-waits for elements to appear).
- Supports parallel test execution.

Common methods:
page.goto("https://example.com")
page.get_by_role("button", name="Login").click()
expect(page.get_by_text("Dashboard")).to_be_visible()

Environment variables such as BROWSER and HEADED let you switch modes:
$env:BROWSER="firefox"; $env:HEADED="true"; pytest -v
