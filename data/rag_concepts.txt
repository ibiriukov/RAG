RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
It combines two main components:
1. A retriever that finds relevant text chunks from stored documents.
2. A generator, like GPT-4, that uses these chunks to produce an informed answer.

RAG improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucination because the model bases its response on actual documents.
A typical RAG pipeline: Ingest data → Embed text → Store vectors → Retrieve top-k → Generate answer.
