RAG Version Control (Embedding Versioning)

In Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, version control is used to manage different generations of document embeddings and their corresponding vector stores.

Each embedding version (e.g., emb_v1, emb_v2, emb_v3) represents a snapshot of:
1. The corpus (documents in the /data folder at the time of build)
2. The embedding model used (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)
3. The chunking strategy (chunk size, overlap)
4. Metadata and preprocessing configuration

The goal is to maintain reproducibility and traceability â€” so that each experiment, test, or production run can be tied to a specific embedding index.

### Why Version Control Matters in RAG

1. **Reproducibility**
   When results change, you can trace which embedding version caused the difference.

2. **Comparative Evaluation**
   Multiple versions can be evaluated with RAGAS metrics:
   - Faithfulness
   - Answer Relevancy
   - Context Precision
   - Answer Correctness

   Example:
