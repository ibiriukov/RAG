LangChain is a Python framework that connects large language models (LLMs) to external data sources and tools.
Key modules:
- Document loaders: read PDFs, text, websites, etc.
- Text splitters: divide long text into smaller chunks.
- Embeddings: turn text into numeric vectors.
- Vector stores: databases like Chroma or FAISS that store and search vectors.
- Chains: connect multiple steps like retrieval and question answering.
LangChain is often used to build RAG applications quickly.
