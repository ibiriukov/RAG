Pytest is a Python testing framework that helps you write and run automated tests.
Key features:
- Simple test naming: any function starting with test_() will be run automatically.
- Assertions: use assert statements to check expected results.
- Fixtures: reusable setup and teardown logic.
- Parametrization: run the same test with multiple data sets.
- Plugins: such as pytest-xdist for parallel runs or pytest-html for reports.

Command examples:
pytest -v                   # verbose mode
pytest -n 3                 # run tests in 3 parallel threads
pytest --html=report.html   # generate HTML report
